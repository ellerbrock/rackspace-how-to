This article describes how to configure a Microsoft&reg; Exchange&reg; 2013 account on your
Apple&reg; iOS 7 device.

**Note:** The images in this article show iPhone&reg; 5 running iOS 7. Although
screens on other iOS devices differ, the process is similar. For more modern iOS versions, refer to the [Cloud Office Email Help Tool](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com) for instructions.

The administrator of your account must verify that an
ActiveSync&reg; license is attached in your account via the Cloud Control
Panel. If any Internet connectivity issues prevent you from
successfully setting up Exchange, contact your wireless provider or
Internet Service Provider (ISP).

1. On the home screen of your device, tap **Settings &gt;** **Mail,
   Contacts, Calendars** &gt; **Add Account**.

   **mex06.emailsrvr.com**. Leave the **Domain** field blank.

**Note:** Depending on how much data is in the mailbox, it might take some
time before your information is completely downloaded into your device.
